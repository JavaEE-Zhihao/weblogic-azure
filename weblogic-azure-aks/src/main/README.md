# About WebLogic on Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service

As part of a broad-ranging partnership between Oracle and Microsoft, this project offers support for running Oracle WebLogic Server in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The partnership includes joint support for a range of Oracle software running on Azure, including Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Linux, and Oracle DB, as well as interoperability between Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Azure. 

This is the main/root git repository for the Azure Resource Management (ARM) templates and other scripts used for the implementation of WebLogic Server on Microsoft Azure AKS.
